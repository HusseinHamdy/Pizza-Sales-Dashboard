# key Features

Data Collection:

- The sales data is initially collected in an Excel dataset, which includes information like order details (pizza type, quantity, and price), and sales metrics (total revenue).
- This data is then integrated into SQL Server for better storage, scalability, and performance. SQL Server serves as the centralized database, managing large volumes of data efficiently.

Data Integration:

The Excel dataset is imported and integrated into SQL Server, ensuring that all historical and real-time sales data is stored in one place. This integration enables seamless data flow and centralization, allowing for more complex queries and analysis.
