# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard
# Overview
This project involves creating an interactive and detailed sales report for a pizza restaurant, utilizing Power BI for data visualization, Excel as the data source, and SQL Server for data storage and management. The goal is to analyze the restaurantâ€™s sales performance, track trends, and provide insights that can help with decision-making and business optimization
# key Features

Data Collection:

- The sales data is initially collected in an Excel dataset, which includes information like order details (pizza type, quantity, and price), and sales metrics (total revenue).
- This data is then integrated into SQL Server for better storage, scalability, and performance. SQL Server serves as the centralized database, managing large volumes of data efficiently.

Data Integration:

The Excel dataset is imported and integrated into SQL Server, ensuring that all historical and real-time sales data is stored in one place. This integration enables seamless data flow and centralization, allowing for more complex queries and analysis.

Data Transformation:

Power Query is used for cleaning and preparing the data. This may include tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring that data is formatted correctly for analysis.

Data Visualization:

Using Power BI, the integrated data from SQL Server is turned into insightful visualizations
